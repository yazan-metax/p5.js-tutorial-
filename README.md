<h1 align="center">Interactive Geometric Animation in p5.js üî•</h1>

**Embark on an interactive journey through the rhythmic pulsations of geometry with this p5.js sketch. This project is a confluence of art and mathematics, where a dynamic wireframe star shape serves as the canvas for your digital manipulations, transforming with your input to create a personalized visual symphony.**


# Overviewüòé:

## Experience the allure of a 3D wireframe model that not only evolves over time but also bends to your will. As you adjust the inputs, the multi-pointed star shape alters its form, allowing for a unique and tailored visual display with each interaction.

# Features:

- **nteractive Wireframe Dynamics:** Users can directly influence the wireframe's behavior by changing specific input parameters, engaging in a hands-on creation of digital art.

- **Color Transitions:** The animation‚Äôs palette transitions from cool to warm hues, dynamically linked to the sine of the frame count, presenting a lively spectrum of colors.

- **Transformative Motion:** Through user input, the rotation and orientation of the shape can be altered, offering new perspectives and revealing the hidden intricacies of the geometry.

- **Mathematically Driven Variations:** The positions of the vertices are determined by mathematical functions, which can be influenced by user interaction, allowing for an infinite array of possibilities.


# Interaction GuideüöÄ:

## To interact with the shape and modify its structure, consider adjusting the following inputs within the code:

- **`frameCount dependency`:** The overall evolution of the animation is tied to the frame count. You can change the rate at which frameCount increments to speed up or slow down the transformations.
  
- **`rotate` functions:** Modify the angles in the rotateX(), rotateY(), and `rotate(frameCount / 50)` functions to alter the rotation speed and axis, creating a diverse range of motion effects.

- **Color mapping:** By changing the parameters in the `map()` functions that link r, g, and b values to frameCount, `i`, and `cos(frameCount)`, you can create new color gradients and patterns.

- **translate function:** Adjust the `translate(0, -700, 0)` values to move the shape within the 3D canvas, affecting the perceived depth and orientation.

# Engage and Contribute ü§ù:

This project is open for experimentation, and your creative touch is highly encouraged. Adjust the inputs, experiment with new mathematical formulas, and share your version of the animation. Together, let's push the boundaries of what p5.js can do!
